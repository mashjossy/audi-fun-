<h1 style ="font-size:40px;">A brief history of Audi</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Audi is one of the best-selling luxury automobile manufacturers in the world. However, the origins of the German brand are complex and colourful, to say the least.<br>
Behind the name of every car company, there’s a story. Sometimes it’s as simple as the name of the family who founded it (Bentley, for example), sometimes it’s an acronym for a phrase people don’t seem to remember. <br>The story behind Audi, however, is that little bit more interesting. OSV takes a look at the rich history of the German brand in our Audi history.
<h1 style ="font-size:40px;">How did the Audi get their name</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Audi was technically founded way back in 1885 when the Wanderer Company was established, later becoming a branch of Audi.<br>
But it was in 1899 that August Horch established A. Horch & Cie in Cologne, then went on to form the August Horch & Cie. Motowagenwerke AG in 1904.However, this didn’t last for very long and Horch left Motowagenwerke in 1909, founding his own company August Horch Authomobilewerke GmbH. You may have noticed that all these company names sound very similar because his old company definitely did. They sued Horch for trademark infringement and the Supreme Court agreed. Horch then had to come up with a new name for his company. So, how did he get to Audi? Well, Horch in Latin is Audi, which means ‘to listen’. And thus, Audi was born. In April 1910 Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau was officially created.
<br>From 1915, it was named Audiwerke AG Zwickau. Zwickau was of course where the company was located, which is in the state of Saxony.
<h1 style ="font-size:40px;">How did the Audi get their logo</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">The Audi logo came about after a merger of four companies. In 1928, engineer Jørgen Rasmussen acquired majority shares in Audi. Soon, the company merged with Rasmussen’s DKW, Wanderer and Audi’s old competitor Horch to form the Auto Union in 1932. The merger led to the creation of the four interlocking rings.Funnily enough, this emblem was also similar to the Olympic Rings (which you’ve also probably noticed). So much so that the Olympic Committee eventually took them to court in 1995. The result was as you’d expect, the court ruled that the Audi rings had nothing to do with the Olympic rings. And so the two logos live in harmony.
<h1 style ="font-size:40px;">Audi's Modern Era</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Audi’s modern era has proven to be as technologically innovative as ever, starting with the 1980s turbocharged Quattro, the world’s first four-wheel drive sports coupe. The company’s official name was shortened to Audi AG, and this was the start of the shift towards the luxury market. In 1987 the Audi put forward the Audi 90, the much more elegant and superior follow up from the Audi 80 which was developing a ‘grandfather’s car’ image.
<br>The release of the Audi V8 was Audi’s debut into the upscale market, competing with the likes of Mercedes-Benz and BMW.
<h1 style ="font-size:40px;">Audi Today</h1>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Sales grew strongly during the 2000s and this continued into this decade. Audi saw record sales in May 2011 and produce vehicles in seven countries across the world.
